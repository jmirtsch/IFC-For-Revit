<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
This application seamlessly replaces the built-in IFC mechanism.  Please use the standard IFC import and export UI to access this functionality.</p>

The export alternate interface is loaded when users access the Export functionality using Revit UI. This alternate interface offers a flexible set of options to configure the export. The options include:</p>
<p>
<p><strong>IFC version</strong>:</p>
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010 – This is a variant of the standard IFC 2x3 used for submitting files to the US Government Services Administration.  Additional property sets will be included.</li> 
<li>IFC 2x2 Singapore BCA e-Plan Check - This is a certified variant of IFC 2x2 used for submitting files to the Singapore BCA e-Plan Check Server. When exporting to this file type, you should make sure that all room-bounding elements are selected.
<li>IFC 4 Basic Coordination View 2.0 - This is the IFC4 equivalent of the IFC2x3 Coordination View 2.0 MVD.  This should be considered a beta file format.  Note also that our IFC toolkit does not support IFC4 ifcXML files, and that UR1 is needed to correct a bug in the toolkit that prevents IFC4 output from standard Revit 2014.</li>
</li></menu>
<p><strong>File Type</strong>: The file format</p>
<menu><li>IFC</li>
<li>IFC XML</li>
<li>Zipped IFC</li>
<li>Zipped IFC XML</li></menu>
<p><strong>Space boundaries</strong>: The level of room/space boundaries exported:</p>
<menu>
<li>None – room/space boundaries are not exported</li>
<li>1st level – the room/space boundaries are included but are not optimized to split elements with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
<li>2nd level – the room/space boundaries are included and are split with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>Phase to export</strong>: Selects the phase of the document to export, defaulting to the last phase of the document.  If "Export only elements visible in view" is selected, the phase of the view will be used and this option greyed out.</p>

<p><strong>Export only elements visible in view</strong>: Checked to export only the visible elements of the current view (based on filtering and/or element and category hiding), unchecked to export the entire model.  
<p><strong>Export rooms in 3D views</strong>: If the "export only elements visible in view" is checked, checking this option will export all of the rooms that are contained inside the section box of the selected 3D view.  If there is no active section box, all rooms will be exported.
<p><strong>Export Bounding Box</strong>: Checked to export bounding box representations, Unchecked to exclude them.  This is the the default for GSA export.</p>
<p><strong>Export Linked Files as Separate IFCs</strong>: Checked to export any Revit links in the project as separate IFCs, unchecked to exclude them.  Each linked instance in the file will export as a separate IFC file with the right positioning relative to the host file.  Multiple instances of the same linked document will export as separate files, identical except for their position and orientation.  Note that linked IFC files will be re-exported, so may suffer data loss on roundtrip.

<p><strong>Split walls and columns by Level</strong>: Whether or not to split walls and columns by building stories.</p>
<p><strong>Export 2D plan view elements</strong>: Checked to include 2D elements supported by IFC export (notes and filled regions), unchecked to exclude them. </p>

<p><strong>Export Revit property sets</strong>: Checked to include the Revit-specific property sets based on parameter groups.  Unchecked to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export IFC Common property sets</strong>: Checked to include the IFC common property sets, unchecked to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export Schedules as property sets</strong>: Checked to export schedules as custom property sets.  The name of the schedule is the property set name; the column names are the IFC parameter names.</p>
<p><strong>Export only schedules containing IFC, Pset, or Common in the title</strong>: When checked, restricts the schedules exported to only those that contain "IFC", "PSet", or "Common" in their title.
<p><strong>Export user defined property sets</strong>: Checked to export user-defined property set.  If checked, the use can specify the name of a text file that contains the property set definitions.</p>

<p><strong>Export base quantities</strong>: Whether or not to include base quantities for model elements in the export data.  Base quantities are generated from model geometry to reflect actual physical quantity values, independent of measurement rules or methods.</p>

<p><strong>Export parts as building elements</strong>: Checked to export parts as standard IFC elements, Unchecked to export them as IfcBuildingElementPart.</p>
<p><strong>Allow use of mixed "Solid Model" representation</strong>: Checked to allow for mixing BRep and extrusion geometries for an entity.  This can result in smaller IFC files, but which are not strictly within the standard IFC MVDs.</p>
<p><strong>Level of detail for some element geometry</strong>: Allows control of the level of tessellation for some Revit elements.  Disabling this option will generally result in larger, but more accurate, BRep and profile representations.  The main Revit elements affected by this control are: elbows, floors, pipe fittings, railings, ramps, spaces and stairs.  Highly detailed extrusion profiles are also affected.for these items.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Use family and type name for references</strong>: Checked to use the family and type name for references, unchecked to use the type name only.</p>
<p><strong>Use 2D room boundaries for room volume</strong>: Checked to use a simplified approach to calculation of room volumes (based on extrusion of 2D room boundaries) which is also the default when exporting to IFC 2x2.   Unchecked to use the Revit calculated room geometry to represent the room volumes (which is the default when exporting to IFC 2x3).</p>
<p><strong>Include IFCSITE elevation in the site local placement origin</strong>: Checked to include the elevation from the Z offset of the IFCSITE local placement, unchecked to exclude it.</p>
<p><strong>Store IFC GUID in file after export</strong>: Optionally allow storing the generated IFC GUIDs into the project file after export. This will add "IFC GUID" parameters to elements and their types, and Project Information for Project, Site, and Building GUIDS. This requires v2.12 of the expoter to add the parameter values, and also requires a manual save. 
</p>

<p>There are 9 built-in setups in the user interface:</p>    
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Basic FM Handover View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Extended FM Handover View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Singapore BCA e-Plan Check</li>
<li>IFC 4 Basic Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 4 Reference View</li>
<li>IFC 4 Design Transfer View</li>

</menu>
    <p>These correspond to the file type options in the standard Revit UI. When selected, the individual options will adjust accordingly. 
    These setups cannot be modified or deleted, but they can be duplicated in order to create a modified version.</p>
    <p>The “In-Session Setup” is a modifiable setup which will not be saved between sessions. You can configure the options as desired.</p>
    <p>You can add additional named setups using the Setup Configuration dialog box using the New or Duplicate options. 
    These configurations will be added to the active document and saved with the document. 
    The add-in will be able to retrieve and reuse these setups if the same model is being exported. 
    You can also rename and delete named setups from this dialog.</p>
    <p> The last two options are for experimental use and have fewer settable options than the rest.</p>


<h2 id="Install" name="Install">Installation and Uninstallation</h2>
<p>
The installer that ran when you downloaded this plug-in from Revit Exchange 
  has already installed the plug-in. You will need to restart Revit to activate 
  the plug-in.
</p>
<p>
To uninstall this plug-in, exit Revit if you are currently running it, 
  simply rerun the installer by downloading it again 
  from Exchange, and select the 'Uninstall' button, or you can uninstall it from 
  'Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features' (Windows 7) or Add/Remove 
  Programs (Windows XP), just as you would uninstall any other application from 
  your system.

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>The alternate export UI is currently provided only in English and French.  The help is currently provided only in English.</p>
<p>The third party toolkit we use to write out IFC files has a limit on the maximum size of IFC file it can create.  
While there is no absolute metric for this, in practice it is about 1.5 GB.  The toolkit provider is aware of these issues and is 
working on expanding and eventually removing this limit, and we will be tracking their progress on this issue.</p>

</ul>

</div>
<div class="version">16.2.0.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">

<br><p>General:

<ul>
<li>This is the IFC2x3 Coordination View 2.0 import certified version of Revit for Link IFC, as seen <a href=http://www.buildingsmart.org/compliance/certified-software/>on the buildingSMART site</a>.  At the time of this writing, it incorrectly lists "Autodesk Revit Architecture" as being import certified instead of "Autodesk Revit".
<li>Both Link and Export will use the IFC4 Addendum 1 schema instead of the IFC4 schema if the IFC4_ADD1.EXP is loaded in the EDM sub-folder of your Revit executable folder.
</ul>

<p>New Export Functionality:

<ul>
<li>Allow setting of IfcBuildingStorey element composition type via IfcElementCompositionType shared parameter for levels.
<li>IFC4: handle elliptical edges for IFC4 Design Transfer View export.
<li>Support export of volumes as liters (a.k.a cubic decimeters)
<li>Support export of volumetric flow rates as liters per second (a.k.a. cubic decimeters per second).
</ul>

<p>New Export UI Functionality:

<ul>
<li>Better progress messages in the status bar.
<li>Remove list of "Current Options" from the starting UI dialog; only display the IFC Schema and MVD as "IFC Version"
<li>Remove path from "Projects to Export" list; the path is now a tooltip.
</ul>

<p>Export Bug Fixes:

<ul>
<li>Correctly toggle between SLIDING_TO_LEFT / SLIDING_TO_RIGHT for flipped doors.
<li>Use the element type "Function" parameter when setting the "IsExternal" common property for all element types, not just wall types.
</ul>

<p>New Import Functionality:

<ul>
<li>Add "IfcElement HasPorts Name" and "IfcElement HasPorts IfcGUID" parameters to show port information for elements.  There will be multiple shared parameters created if the element has multiple ports.
<li>Add support for more thermal transmittance units.
<li>Entities that are decomposed by IfcBuildingElementPart will now be visible if either the top level category or the Parts category is enabled by default.
<li>If attempting to create an IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel as a Solid results in any dropped faces, import it as a Mesh instead.
<li>If processing an IfcBooleanResult entity results in a failed Revit Boolean operation, try again by slightly shifting (by 1mm) the second of the two geometries in the operation.
<li>Improve import of IfcSweptDiskSolid when the geometric description of the entity would create a self-intersecting surface.  In this case, create the minimum number of solids possible to import as much as the geometry as possible.
<li>Read in IfcSystems that aren't associated to the building via a IfcRelServicesBuildings relation.
<li>Read in IfcPropertyBoundedValues (including support for IFC4 version).

<li>Fix a potential crash if a file contains a large number of elements in system joined by ports.
<li>Improve log message when an entity can't be imported because it has no geometry.
<li>Improve log message when an entity can't create all of the facets of its tessellated geometric representation.
<li>Move some MEP entities from Generic Models category to the appropriate categories by default.
</ul>

</div>

<div class="version">16.1.0.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">

<br><p>General:

<ul>
<li>Special thanks to CAD-Q (http://www.cad-q.com/) for their contribution of this improvement to the Open Source.  Their contributions will be marked with (CADQ) below.
<li>The installer has been updated to once again work with Revit LT.
</ul>

<p>New Export Functionality:

<ul>
<li>(CADQ) Ability to export only schedules whose titles include "PSet", "IFC" or "Common".
<li>(CADQ) Added option to use the active view to generate the exported geometry.  Note that this can have unexpected effects if used in a non-3D view.
<li>(CADQ) Added an export progress report to the status bar, similar to how Link IFC displays progress.
<li>(CADQ) Allow export of multiple loaded exportable projects.  Note that for phasing, the list of available phases will be based on the current project only.  If a phase other than the default phase is chosen, it will be used for all projects assuming that they have the same phase with the same element id.  If multiple projects are chosen, default names will be uesd for the created files in the chosen folder.
<li>(CADQ) Split walls and columns by level now also splits duct segments by level.
<li>(CADQ) The "Advanced" tab tessellation level of detail controls now also apply to pipe fittings.  In addition, instead of being a checkbox, there are now four options: "Extra Low", "Low", "Medium" and "High".  The default setting is Low, which is slightly higher than the previous setting.
<li>(CADQ) When splitting elements by level, if the splitting operation fails, use the original solid.
<li>Added a setup for the IFC4 Design Transfer View MVD.  This is still a work in progress and is intended for advanced users to experiment with.  The bulk of the new functionality is around using the IfcAdvancedBRep to generate non-faceted geometry and topology on export.
<li>Added support for properties with friction loss and linear velocity units, both for standard Revit properties and user defined property sets.
<li>All properties for PSet_ZoneCommon are prepended with "Zone" to distinguish them from Room properties.  See the wiki for more information.
</ul>

<p>Export Bug Fixes:

<ul>
<li>(CADQ) IFC2x3: PSet_ZoneCommon now correctly exports "GrossAreaPlanned" and "NetAreaPlanned" properties (instead of the IFC4 GrossPlannedArea and NetPlannedArea).
<li>Allow export of IfcElectricDistributionPoint (IFC2x3) and IfcElectricDistributionBoard (IFC4) entity types.
<li>Allow export of DirectShapes in certain categories that were previously ignored.
<li>Allow export of some infill elements in host objects.  Infill elements are created when a host object has an opening that is not in the currently exported phase.
<li>Exporting schedules as property sets will now include room elements.
<li>Fix orientation of some floors exported as containers.
<li>IFC2x3: Allow export of type properties for elements whose corresponding IFC entity doesn't have a type in user-defined property sets assigned to "IfcElementType".
<li>Significantly improve the export of walls with openings in the corners. Both the wall profile and the opening geometry have been improved to reflect user intent, and fewer clip planes are used.
<li>Switch between the IFC4 IfcBurner/IfcBurnerType and IfcSpaceHeater/IfcSpaceHeaterType and their IFC2x3 counterparts depending on the schema version.
</ul>

<p>New Import Functionality:

<ul>
<li>Always reload a linked IFC file if the importer version is different than the one used to originally link the IFC file.
<li>Better handling of IFC color information when scaling is involved.
<li>Create the log file earlier, allowing for logging of more general failures.
<li>If the default log file is locked, create a log file with a temporary name in the same directory.
<li>Log an error if no template file could be found to generate an IFC file.
<li>Log an error if the IFC file contains a zero length vectors used in local coordinate systems.
<li>Process IfcPresentationLayerAssignment for grids.
<li>Store IfcProject, IfcSite and IfcBuilding parameters and GUIDs in Revit Project Information if no element was created for them.
</ul>

<p>Import Bug Fixes:

<ul>
<li>Correctly rotate projects whose true north deviates from project north.
<li>Correct unit scaling and symbol display for friction loss, linear velocity, luminous efficacy, thermal transmittance, and volumetric flow rate.
<li>Include units when displaying material thicknesses in the IfcMaterialList parameter and in some log messages.
<li>Import extruded geometry whose profile is a single, unbounded, closed curve (e.g., a fule circle or ellipse).
<li>Improve creation of geometry in cases where a Solid couldn't be created, and we reverted to Mesh geometry instead.
<li>Improve material assignment for geometries where the material was attached to the first argument of a Boolean operation.
<li>Properly scale IfcVertexPoint input.
<li>Stop displaying irrelevant property sets in the IfcPropertySetList parameter.
