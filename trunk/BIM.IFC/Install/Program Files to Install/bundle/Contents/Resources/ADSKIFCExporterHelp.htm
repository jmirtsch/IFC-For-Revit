    <p> 
    The IFC exporter for Revit 2013 contains up-to-date improvements on the default IFC export capabilities of Revit contributed by Autodesk and our Open 
    Source contributors.  While this app is not necessary for IFC support, it is recommended that users that depend on the quality of their IFC export 
    download this app and keep it up-to-date, as new enhancements and defect fixes are added,  For more information on IFC, 
    please visit the <a href="http://buildingsmart.com/standards/ifc" target=_blank>buildingSMART website</a> or the Revit wiki.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The IFC Exporter for Revit 2013 button on the Revit UI provides access to the htm help document and brings up a dialog specifying the version of the 
app installed. This applcation seemlessly replaces the built-in IFC export mechanism and so the users do not have to perform any additional
steps while exporting their models to IFC format using Revit UI.</p>

<h2 id="Install" name="Install">Installation and Uninstallation</h2>
<p>
The installer that ran when you downloaded this plug-in from Revit Exchange 
  has already installed the plug-in. You will need to restart Revit to activate 
  the plug-in.
</p>
<p>
To uninstall this plug-in, exit Revit if you are currenting running it, 
  simply rerun the installer by downloading it again 
  from Exchange, and select the 'Uninstall' button, or you can uninstall it from 
  'Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features' (Windows 7) or Add/Remove 
  Programs (Windows XP), just as you would uninstall any other application from 
  your system.
  </p>
  
<h2 id="AdditionalInfo" name="AdditionalInfo">Additional Information</h2>
<p>
The source code for this application is available on open source, at the SourceForge project :
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ifcexporter/home/Home/" target=_blank>http://sourceforge.net/p/ifcexporter/home/Home/</a></p>
<p>This application is a good complement to the IFC Exporter UI client app, 
also available on the Exchange store.  However, it is not required to get the latest version of that application when 
installing this application.  Nor is it required to use this alternate UI when getting the latest IFC Exporter UI.</p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>The third party toolkit we use to write out IFC files has a limit on the maximum size of IFC file it can create.  
While there is no absolute metric for this, in practice it is about 250MB.  The toolkit provider is aware of these issues and is 
working on expanding and eventually removing this limit, and we will be tracking their progress on this issue.</p>

<h2 id="VersionHistory" name="VersionHistory">Version History</h2>

<div class="versionset">

<div class="version">2.16.0.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">

<p>New Functionality:
<li>Allow the user to specify the name of one field that will serve as a classification.
<li>Allow the user to specify which phase to export, instead of defaulting to the last phase.
<li>Unlimited number of generic "ClassificationCode (x)" fields (up from 10).

<p>Bug Fixes:

<li>Always export OmniClass information if it exists, even if another classification is always provided.

</div>

<div class="version">2.15.1.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">

<p>Bug Fixes:
<li>Fix parameter scaling for many parameter types when exporting schedules as property sets.

</div>

<div class="version">2.15.0.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">

<p>New Functionality:

<li>Create IfcTelecomAddress containing the primary e-mail address of the user if it is set via the alternate UI.
<li>Major improvements on exporting correct values for parameters, including:
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing cleanup of code to make adding new parameters easier.
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited support for currency, based on supported values in Revit.  Some shared currencies (e.g., dollar, krona) may not always have the right locale set.
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve scaling for parameter values on export to respect offset values, primarily for temperature.
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for Celsius in addition to Kelvin.
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for electrical illuminance, luminous flux, luminous intensity, luminous efficacy, and pressure.
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate units for color temperature vs. thermodynamic temperature.

<p>Bug Fixes:

<li>Export styled items for extrusions if exporting solid models via the alternate UI.
<li>Fix regression where items that should have been contained in an IfcSpace were no longer attached to either the IfcSpace or the IfcBuildingStorey.
<li>Improved control over exporting reveals and wall sweeps.
</div>

<div class="version">2.14.0.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">
General:

<li>Minor cleanup to remove extraneous arguments from some functions.
<li>Remove some obsolete code for old IFCDoorStyleOperation and IFCWIndowStyleOperation.

<p>New Functionality:

<li>Add support for Force properties (Newtons).

<p>Bug Fixes:

<li>Correct flow direction calculation for some connector domains, that would abort export of connector information.
<li>Export Authorization field in header as a null string ('$') instead of an empty string if it is not set.
<li>Export correct values for IfcDoor operation.
<li>Export internal ElementId Revit properties as IfcLabel, not IfcText.
<li>Export respects visibility settings of curtain panels if exporting elements in the current view.
<li>Fix export of some schedules with non-exportable fields that would prevent export with exporting of schedules as property sets on.
<li>Fix some caching issues with some parameter values.
<li>Protect against abort of export when trying to export some invalid systems in the Revit file.
<li>Set 2D representations of families to "FootPrint" representation, not "Annotation".
<li>Use IfcMaterial, not IfcMaterialList, if there is only 1 material in the list.
<li>Use IfcMaterialList, not IfcMaterialLayerUsage, for more BRep-based host objects.
</div>

<div class="version">2.13.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">General:

<li>Initialize GUIDOptions so that GUIDUtil.CreateGUID(element) can be used outside of the exporter code.
<li>Remove filterView argument from many functions; used cached value instead.
<li>Various minor optimizations to slightly improve the time to export.

<p>New Functionality:

<li>Allow export schedules as custom property sets.  The name of the schedule is the property set name; the column names are the IFC parameter names.
<li>Allow export of solid models, which allow for mixing Breps an extrusions for an entity.  This can result in smaller IFC files.
<li>Export IfcCurtainWallType (IFC2x2: use IfcTypeObject instead).
<li>Export the currently selected non-primary design option when exporting in current view only mode.
<li>Use the base level parameter of an element to determine which level to associate the element to; use geometric containment only for cases where this is no base level.

<p>Bug Fixes:

<li>Don't export some extraneous local placements.
<li>Don't export type if instance isn't exported for family.
<li>Fix Pset_CoveringCommon: Thickness -> TotalThickness
<li>Generic rework of how instance and type properties are assigned to IFC entities.  If an exported entity has a related type object, then the entity will have the instance properties assigned, and the type object the type properties.  If there is no type object, the exported entity will contain both instance and type properties.  This should also remove any repetition of exported property sets.
<li>Look at all "ZoneName X" shared parameters for a room even if some have no value.  This still assumes that they are sequential (i.e., if there is no "ZoneName 4" shared parameter at all, "ZoneName 5" will not be processed).
<li>Prevent export of IfcPolyLoops with less than 3 vertices.
<li>Properly scale all known Revit parameter types to the units specified for the IFC file.  Note that there are potentially many Revit parameter types that map to one unit type (e.g., PipeSize, WireSize, and Length are both length parameters); we do not create different units for each of these, but instead use the main unit type.
<li>Respect visibilty options of curtain wall panels and mullions when exporting in current view only mode.
<li>Use category id as default for IfcCoverings for ceilings, floors, and roofs.

</div>

<div class="version">2.12.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">
General:

<li>This version is the Revit MEP certified version of the exporter.  Revit is now certified for all 3 possible export certifications: Architectural, Structural, and MEP.
<li>Minor performance improvement by reducing the number of calls to the IFC export mapping table.

<p>New Functionality:

<li>Add new MEP property sets: Pset_SanitaryTerminalBath, Pset_SanitaryTerminalShower, Pset_SanitaryTerminalSink, Pset_SanitaryTerminalWashBasin
<li>Add support for IfcRelCoversBldgElements for ducts and pipes.
<li>Allow association of property set descriptions to a specific pre-defined type of an entity.
<li>Allow exporting foundation and retaining walls as IfcFooting, if set in the IFC export mapping tabble, or using "IfcExportAs" for the particular wall.
<li>Export "SiteLandTitleNumber" and "SiteLongName" shared parameters from Project Information to IfcSite, if they are set.
<li>Optionally allow storing the generated IFC GUIDs into the project file after export.  This will add "IFC GUID" parameters to elements, their types, and Project Information for Project, Site, and Building GUIDS.  This requires version v1.12 of the alternate UI to set the option, and requires a manual save.
<li>Read in ParameterMappingTable.txt, which allows users to specify a mapping from Revit properties to IFC common parameter sets.  Please see the Wiki on custom parameter mapping for more information.  Special thanks to: Tom Pesman (http://nl.linkedin.com/in/tompesman) and the Dutch Revit User Group (www.revitgg.nl / www.dutchrevitstandards.com) for their contribution of this improvement to the Open Source.

<p>Bug Fixes:

<li>Add base equipment to the IfcSystem.
<li>Correct export of true north for IfcSite.
<li>Correct scaling of Voltage values on export.
<li>Move more local coordinate systems closer to the entity's geometry.

<li>Properly calculate Ceiling:Finish property.  Previously, the value was not reset between ceilings, resulting in an ever-growing list of finish materials.
<li>Prevent duplicate GUIDs for some elements and Psets that re-used the same GUID values.  Note that this will have the affect of a one-time change of GUID values for some IfcPropertySets.
<li>Stop duplication of Cartesian points in the output of some BReps.

<li>In the case where linear grid lines were grouped into 3 distinct direction sets, and 2 of the directions were orthogonal, the 3rd set of grid lines would not be exported.  This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Fix issue where elements in assemblies would not be related to building storeys if the parent assembly were marked as not exported.</li>
<li>For properties where they are defined with a different Revit parameter name and IFC property name, if the Revit parameter name is not found, look for the IFC property name.</li>
<li>Only export beam/column/member quantities if "QTO" export is chosen.</li>
<li>Use IfcRelAssignsToGroup, not IfcRelAggregates, for IfcZones; stabilize IfcRelAssignsToGroup GUID.</li>
