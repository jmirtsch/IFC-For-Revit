<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The Revit IFC Export Alternate UI 2014 button on the Revit UI provides access to the htm help document and brings up a dialog specifying the version of the app installed. 
The alternate interface is loaded when users access the Export functionality using Revit UI. This alternate interface offers a flexible set of options to configure the export. The options include:</p>
<p>
<p><strong>IFC version</strong>:</p>
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010 – This is a variant of the standard IFC 2x3 used for submitting files to the US Government Services Administration.  Additional property sets will be included.</li> 
<li>IFC 2x2 Singapore BCA e-Plan Check - This is a certified variant of IFC 2x2 used for submitting files to the Singapore BCA e-Plan Check Server. When exporting to this file type, you should make sure that all room-bounding elements are selected.
<li>IFC 4 Basic Coordination View 2.0 - This is the IFC4 equivalent of the IFC2x3 Coordination View 2.0 MVD.  Note that there are still no official IFC 4 MVDs, so this should be considered a beta file format.  Note also that our IFC toolkit does not support IFC4 ifcXML files, and that UR1 is needed to correct a bug in the toolkit that prevents IFC4 output from standard Revit 2014.</li>
</li></menu>
<p><strong>File Type</strong>: The file format</p>
<menu><li>IFC</li>
<li>IFC XML</li>
<li>Zipped IFC</li>
<li>Zipped IFC XML</li></menu>
<p><strong>Space boundaries</strong>: The level of room/space boundaries exported:</p>
<menu>
<li>None – room/space boundaries are not exported</li>
<li>1st level – the room/space boundaries are included but are not optimized to split elements with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
<li>2nd level – the room/space boundaries are included and are split with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>Phase to export</strong>: Selects the phase of the document to export, defaulting to the last phase of the document.  If "Export only elements visible in view" is selected, the phase of the view will be used and this option greyed out.</p>
<p><strong>Export base quantities</strong>: Whether or not to include base quantities for model elements in the export data.  Base quantities are generated from model geometry to reflect actual physical quantity values, independent of measurement rules or methods.</p>
<p><strong>Split walls and columns by Level</strong>: Whether or not to split walls and columns by building stories.</p>
<p><strong>Export internal Revit property sets</strong>: True to include the Revit-specific property sets based on parameter groups.  False to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export IFC Common property sets</strong>: True to include the IFC common property sets.  False to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export Schedules as property sets</strong>: True to export schedules as custom property sets.  The name of the schedule is the property set name; the column names are the IFC parameter names.</p>
<p><strong>Export only elements visible in view</strong>: True to export only the visible elements of the current view (based on filtering and/or element and category hiding).  False to export the entire model.  
<p><strong>Export parts as building elements</strong>: True to export parts as standard IFC elements, false to export them as IfcBuildingElementPart.</p>
<p><strong>Export 2D plan view elements</strong>: True to include 2D elements supported by IFC export (notes and filled regions). False to exclude them. </p>
<p><strong>Export Bounding Box</strong>: True to export bounding box representations, false to exclude them.  This is the forced to true for GSA export.</p>
<p><strong>Export Solid Models when possible</strong>: True to export solid models when applicable, which allow for mixing BRep and extrusion geometries for an entity.  This can result in smaller IFC files.</p>
<p><strong>Use family and type name for references</strong>: True to use the family and type name for references, false to use the type name only.</p>
<p><strong>Use 2D room boundaries for room volume</strong>: True to use a simplified approach to calculation of room volumes (based on extrusion of 2D room boundaries) which is also the default when exporting to IFC 2x2.   False to use the Revit calculated room geometry to represent the room volumes (which is the default when exporting to IFC 2x3).</p>
<p><strong>Include IFCSITE elevation in the site local placement origin</strong>: True to include the elevation from the Z offset of the IFCSITE local placement, false to exclude it. It’s not available for IFC Coordination View 2.0 file version.</p>
<p><strong>Use coarse tessellation for some BReps</strong>: True to use coarse tessellation for some Revit elements (floors, railings, ramps, spaces and stairs).  Disabling this option will generally result in larger, but more accurate, BRep representations for these items.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Store IFC GUID in file after export</strong>: Optionally allow storing the generated IFC GUIDs into the project file after export. This will add "IFC GUID" parameters to elements and their types, and Project Information for Project, Site, and Building GUIDS. This requires v2.12 of the expoter to add the parameter values, and also requires a manual save. 
</p>
<p>There are 7 built-in setups in the user interface:</p>    
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Basic FM Handover View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Singapore BCA e-Plan Check</li>
<li>IFC 4 Basic Coordination View 2.0</li>

</menu>
    <p>These correspond to the file type options in the standard Revit UI. When selected, the individual options will adjust accordingly. 
    These setups cannot be modified or deleted, but they can be duplicated in order to create a modified version.</p>
    <p>The “In-Session Setup” is a modifiable setup which will not be saved between sessions. You can configure the options as desired.</p>
    <p>You can add additional named setups using the Setup Configuration dialog box using the New or Duplicate options. 
    These configurations will be added to the active document and saved with the document. 
    The add-in will be able to retrieve and reuse these setups if the same model is being exported. 
    You can also rename and delete named setups from this dialog.</p>

General:<br/>
We did some work to try to make the UI a little more user-friendly.  This wasn't intended as a complete overhaul, but instead an improvement within the current setup of the alternate UI.  This includes:<br/>
1st Page of Export:
<li>Change default to "IFC2x3 Coordination View 2.0" MVD from "Default 2x3", which was the original IFC2x3 Coordination View MVD.
<li>Don't create an "Update Setups" transaction unless "Modify Setup..." is chosen.
<li>Move the "Export..." button to the lower-right, next to the "Cancel" button.
<li>Remove the "Save setups and close" button; setups will be automatically saved when pressing "OK" button "Modify Setup" page.
<li>Re-order and rename the built-in configurations to match the real file versions and MVD names.
<li>Sort the table into "included" and "not included" for customizable options.<br/>
2nd Page of Export:
<li>OK button saves configuration changes; no need for "Save setups and close" button.
<li>Re-group the custom options into more logical groups.
</div>
<div class="version">2.1.0</div><div class="versioninfo-bullet">First Release</div>
